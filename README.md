# Project - Simulations of Random Walks

This project is a modelling based work on Random Variables. It deals with probability problems that can be verified via computer simulation.

### Prerequisites

Simulations are all done in python3 codes and uses following additional python3 libraries:

*pynum
*math
*random

## Running the tests

All simulations are basically implemented in a function or two. The function are mostly straightforward and must be called manually. An example function-call for each is given in the files.

## Simulation Tasks

Following are the descriptions of each task.

### Task1
### Task2
### Task3
### Task4
### Task5
### Task7
### Task8
