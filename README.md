# Project - Simulations of Random Walks

This project is a modelling based work on Random Variables. It deals with some probability problems that can be verified via computer simulation.

### Prerequisites

Simulations are all done in python3 codes and uses following additional python3 libraries:

* pynum
* math
* random

## Running the tests

All simulations are basically implemented in a function or two. The function are mostly straightforward and must be called manually. An example function-call for each is given in the files.

## Simulation Tasks

Following are the descriptions of each task.

### Task1

* A one-dimensional discrete random walk mathematical and simulation-based model to predict the expected distance from the starting point.

### Task2

* A one-dimensional random walk mathematical and simulation-based model where two people start x units away from each other and are traversing the grid with some probabilities. The simulation predicts the expected time it takes to meet them.

### Task3

* Simulates a two-dimensional random walk with discrete step-size {0, 0.5, 1} and discrete orientation {North, South, East, West}.

### Task4

* A one-dimensional continuous random walk mathematical and simulation-based model to predict the expected distance from the starting point.

### Task5

* Simulates a two-dimensional random walk with continuous step-size 0 - 1 and continuous orientation 0 - 2π.

### Task7

* Simulates a two-dimensional random walk with discrete step-size {0, 0.5, 1} and continuous orientation 0 - 2π.

### Task8

* Picking a random point within a continuous circular region uniformly.
* calculating the average number of steps needed for two such random points to come with 1 unit range of each other in a circular region.
