""" ----------------------------------- TASK 4 -----------------------------------------
Repeat task 1 by assuming that the step size is a continuous uniform random variable between 0 âˆ’ 1.
Again, you may find it easier to model the PDF as a uniform random variable


Task1: Create a one-dimensional random walk mathematical and simulation-based model to predict the
ex-pected  distance  from  the  starting  point.   You  should  test  your  models  for
range  of  scenarios  e.g.starting position, (un)equal probabilities of moving left, right,
and not moving at all.
